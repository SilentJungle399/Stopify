# Stopify

Majority of the code is recycled from a very old project of mine, so expect random bits of code which has no use.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run electron:serve
```

### Compiles and packages the app for production

```
npm run electron:build
```
